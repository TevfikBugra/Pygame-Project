  # Description of the Game  
In the game, there are two enemy planets. These planets can create different types of
spaceships, with certain advantages and disadvantages. These spaceships come across on a
battlefield of three straight lanes. Spaceships created in a lane fight against spaceships
coming from the same lane. Planets are located on both sides of this area and must be
protected from the enemy throughout the game. The goal is to reach and destroy the enemy
planet by eliminating the enemy spaceships first. In order to do this, the player should choose
the right type of spaceships and send them to the right lane. Since the lane of a created
spaceship cannot be changed later, line selection has a crucial place in winning the game.
Thus, an effective strategy is needed to surpass the enemy. Besides the lane selection, the
spaceship selection is just as important. Spaceships, which differ in features such as range,
fire rate, health, speed, should be chosen in the most effective way, considering the conditions
of each lane. With every enemy spaceship destroyed in the game, some money is earned.
With the money earned, new spaceships can be purchased. In addition to all these, there is a
special skill that when activated can change the fate of the game. With the usage of this skill,
all friendly spaceships become immortal for a certain period of time. This skill can change
the course of the game with its power. However, since the cooldown time is quite long, it is
important to choose the right time to use the skill. If a planet takes too much damage from
enemy spaceships and loses all of its health, it will be destroyed, and the game will be over.
